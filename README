embryo
------------------------------------------
Embryo is primarily a shared library that gives you an API to load and 
control interpreted programs compiled into an abstract machine bytecode 
that it understands.  This abstract (or virtual) machine is similar to a 
real machine with a CPU, but it is emulated in software.  The 
architecture is simple and is the same as the abstract machine (AMX) in 
the PAWN language (formerly called SMALL) as it is based on exactly the 
same code. Embryo has modified the code for the AMX extensively and has 
made it smaller and more portable.  It is VERY small.  The total size of 
the virtual machine code AND header files is less than 2500 lines of 
code.  It includes the floating point library support by default as 
well.  This makes it one of the smallest interpreters around, and thus 
makes is very efficient to use in code.

Build instructions:
  unpack embryo-0.9.9.063-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./embryo-0.9.9.063-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/embryo-0.9.9.063-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/embryo-0.9.9.063-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libembryo-devel-0.9.9.063-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libembryo05-0.9.9.063-X.tar.bz2
